        Welcome to my web page!</h2>
        <p>I was born in Mexico City but moved with my family to Provo Utah
        When I was 16 years old. I love Utah and the church culture is awesome.<br> 
        I am computer science major and I am still figuring out the details 
        of what that entails. <br>One thing I love from BYU-I is the burritos they
        sell in the crossroads. One thing i don't love from BYU-I is the snow we 
        are getting, I got my car stuck in the snow and took me 15 min and a shovel 
        to get it out.</p>
        <p>See ya, aligator</p>
