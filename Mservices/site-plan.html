      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I work to help people feel better by bringing harmony and order to their spaces.
        I have a cleaning business.
        We do any type of cleaning but specialize in housekeeping.
        Have you ever had a bad day at work? Maybe your boss screamed at you, or you had to deal with some difficult customers or clients. 
        And after work you step into your house and feel the dirt in the carpet from not cleaning it in weeks, the smell of trash, a sink full of dishes, and don’t get me started in the bathroom. 
        Cleaning is a necessary to keep your sanity in your refuge from the day to day. 
        We are a cleaning service company like no other. Our personalized services let you choose what you want to have cleaned in your house, what products you want our housekeepers to use, and what fragrance you want your space to smell after the cleaning (lavender, wood, spiced apple, forest, ocean). All this with just a request in our web page.  
        </p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is going to be small business owners, homeowners, apartment complex managers, basically anyone that needs a space to get cleaned in the Utah and Salt Lake County. 
        The people that will use this web page are those space owners that want to schedule our services, this can be a onetime only (first time cleaning) or a repeated cleaning services that could be scheduled weekly, monthly, or quarterly. I think the people that will widely use this app will be homeowners.
